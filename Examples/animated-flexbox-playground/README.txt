 Animating Flexbox properties using relative animations. Layout is done with CSS. [GreenSock](http://greensock.com) is used to animate the difference in layout changes. Animations will also play if you resize the window.

Based on the [Flexbox Playground](http://codepen.io/enxaneta/pen/adLPwv/) created by [Gabi](http://codepen.io/enxaneta/).

TODO: Use additive animations.
